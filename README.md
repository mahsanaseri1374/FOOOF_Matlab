# FOOOF_Matlab

This repository contains MATLAB and Python scripts for analyzing neural power spectra using the FOOOF (Fitting Oscillations and One Over F) method. FOOOF decomposes power spectra into aperiodic (1/f) and oscillatory components, allowing for a detailed analysis of neural data.

## Features

- **FOOOF Analysis in MATLAB**: Perform FOOOF fitting on power spectra with `FOOOF_analysis.m`.
- **Preprocessing**: `Matlab-PreProcessing.m` provides tools for data preprocessing.
- **Python Compatibility**: `python_fooofing.py` integrates MATLAB data with Pythonâ€™s FOOOF library.
- **Power Spectral Density Calculation**: `Calculate_Psd.m` computes the PSD for neural signals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB R2021a or later
- Python 3.7+ (for FOOOF in Python)
- Required packages: `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `scipy`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahsanaseri1374/FOOOF_Matlab.git
   
2. Install Python dependencies:

bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Preprocess your data using Matlab-PreProcessing.m.
    Compute the power spectral density with Calculate_Psd.m.
    Run the FOOOF analysis using FOOOF_analysis.m.
